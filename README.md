# Softuni-Programming-Basics
Containing the tasks from Softuni's course Programming Basics.

The repository was recreated on Jan 27th 2017 in order to include the whole projects and not the .cs files only. Also .gitignore file was added.

The course gives initial programming skills:

- working with IDE (Visual Studio);
- using variables, operators, expressions;
- using the console for input and output of data;
- using conditional statements - if, if - else, switch - case;
- using loops - for, while, do-while, foreach;
